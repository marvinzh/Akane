## Akane
### a collection of Machine Learning algorithms for Regression, Classification, and Clustering

###Introduction
Akane is a collection of Machine Learning algorithms for Regression, Classification, and Clustering. Currently, Akane provides the following algorithms:
- **Regression**
    - Simple Linear Regression
    - Linear Regression with L1 Regularization (a.k.a. Lasso Regression)
    - Linear Regression with L2 Regularization (a.k.a. Ridge Regression)
    - Linear Regression With L1 & L2 Regularization (a.k.a. Elastic Net)
    - Polynomial Regression
    - Kernel Regression

- **Classification**
	- Logistic Regression
	- Decision Tree
	- _Support Vector Machine_
	- AdaBoost
	- Neural Networks

- **Cluster**
	- k-means
	- nearest neighbor
	- gaussion mixure model

###Prerequisite
- Python(3.5.0)+
- numpy(1.11.0)+
- scipy(0.17.1)+
- pandas(0.18.1)+
- PyLBFGS(0.2.0.3)+
